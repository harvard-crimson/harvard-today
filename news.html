            <div class="section-body">Members of HUCTW negotiate mo' money: Whether there will also be "Mo' Problems" remains unclear, but members of Harvard's largest employee union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, were happy to hear the details of significant changes to health care benefits and wage compensation after many months of negotiations. </br></br>
            GSAS shows some love to parents: Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students who are expecting children can now also count on more time off and a larger stipend. The change doubled the amount of leave time for students who are expecting, and added a $6,264 stipend. Ahh, the miracles (and economic burdens) of childbirth.</br></br>
            Law school remembers Scalia: Over this past weekend Law School alumnus and Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia passed away, leaving a vacant spot on the Supreme Court.

            <div class="section-body">It's raining from my eyes: This weekend was extremely cold, which was probably a good thing for couples on Valentine's Day, but was the worst thing ever for the rest of us.

            Kanye's New Album: Between the release of Beyonce's "Formation" last week, and Kanye's new album this week, the music world has (I can't think of something funny to put here). While we're very excited to have new music to hear at every party for the next few months (no offense, but "Sorry" is getting kind of old), we're a little confused by "The Life of Pablo." Mostly because it's only on Tidal, meaning that we'll never actually get the chance to listen to it.</br></br>
            Oooh, you're my best friend: The Queen song may have been written about their bassist's wife, but it also may have been written about Conan O'Brien and a Crimson staff writer who met him on Friday. Yeah, that's probably it.</div></div>

            South Korea's Downfall? - South Korean President Park Geun Hye announced to his country's Parliament that recent moves by North Korea to develop its nuclear capabilities will hasten the collapse of North Korea's government. All that I ask for is that North Korea take back its claims to inventing the hamburger, which is as American as apple pie and, well, hamburgers.</div></div>
